**ADR #001: Using Laravel Framework with MySQL Database**  

**Date:** 01-12-2024

---

### **Context**  
We need a web application framework and a relational database to develop a scalable, maintainable, and secure application. Laravel and MySQL are strong candidates due to their features, community support, and compatibility.  

### **Decision**  
We will use **Laravel** as the primary backend framework and **MySQL** as the database management system for this project.  

### **Rationale**  
#### **Why Laravel?**  
1. **MVC Architecture:** Simplifies codebase management by separating business logic, data, and UI.  
2. **Built-in Tools:** Offers tools like Eloquent ORM, Blade templating, and built-in authentication.  
3. **Community and Ecosystem:** Large community support, robust packages, and active documentation.  
4. **Scalability and Maintainability:** Laravel supports application scaling and clean code practices.  

#### **Why MySQL?**  
1. **Performance and Reliability:** Proven efficiency for handling large datasets.  
2. **Compatibility with Laravel:** Eloquent ORM works seamlessly with MySQL for data handling.  
3. **Community Support:** Wide usage across the industry ensures abundant learning resources.  
4. **Cost:** Open-source and free to use for development.  

### **Alternatives Considered**  
#### **Framework Alternatives:**  
1. **Next.js:**  
   - **Pros:** Server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), great for SEO, and built-in frontend framework.  
   - **Cons:** Primarily a frontend-focused framework, requiring separate APIs or backend services for complex backend logic.  

2. **Filament:**  
   - **Pros:** Simplified Laravel-based admin panel development, rapid prototyping, and UI generation.  
   - **Cons:** Not designed as a full-stack framework; heavily dependent on Laravel for backend features, so it's better suited as a complementary tool than a primary framework.  

#### **Database Alternatives:**  
1. **PostgreSQL:** Offers advanced features but wasn't chosen as MySQL is more familiar to the team.  
2. **SQLite:** Unsuitable for production-level scalability needs.  

### **Consequences**  
- **Positive:**  
  - Faster development with Laravel's built-in features.  
  - Efficient data handling with MySQL and Eloquent ORM.  
  - Easier debugging and future enhancements due to clean architecture.  

- **Negative:**  
  - Dependency on Laravel's specific ecosystem may require additional onboarding for new developers unfamiliar with the framework.  
  - MySQL lacks certain advanced features like PostgreSQL (e.g., JSONB indexing).  

### **Implementation Plan**  
1. Install Laravel via Composer and set up a new project.  
2. Configure `.env` file with MySQL credentials (e.g., `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`).  
3. Use Laravel's `artisan` CLI for migrations and seeding.  
4. Integrate Eloquent ORM for seamless database interaction.  
5. Define database schema and relationships using migrations and models.  

### **Status**  
Accepted  

### **Notes**  
We may revisit this decision in the future if a shift in requirements or team expertise justifies transitioning to Next.js for frontend-heavy projects or leveraging Filament for admin-specific tasks.
